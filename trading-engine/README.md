# Capital Fund — Multi-Model Quant Trading Workspace

A self-contained, **paper-trading-first** quant system that picks ETFs every
month and submits orders to your Interactive Brokers paper account, all
on its own. Comes with a live dashboard, a kill switch, a system-health
audit page, and an extensible model catalogue you can add new strategies
to without touching the runtime.

> If you know what SPY, QQQ, and a momentum factor are but `pip install`
> still feels foreign, this README will walk you through it. **Plan on
> ~45 minutes for first install** if you don't have Python or IBKR set up
> yet, ~10 minutes if you do.

## What it does, in plain English

1. **Every weekday at 4:32 PM ET**, your Mac wakes (if asleep), connects
   to a running TWS or IB Gateway window, and pulls today's close prices
   for ~22 ETFs.
2. It runs the **multi-model strategy** — 14 different signal generators
   (momentum, mean reversion, volatility-targeting, MACD, RSI, …) score
   every ETF, an aggregator combines those scores into target weights,
   and an optimizer (optional) refines them with a covariance model.
3. If today is a rebalance day, it builds a basket and **submits market
   orders** to your paper account at IBKR.
4. A pre-trade **risk gate** and a **kill switch** guard every order
   submission. If anything looks wrong (concentration breach, stale data,
   kill switch armed) the system aborts before any network call to IBKR.
5. You can watch all of this in a Streamlit dashboard (`localhost:8501`)
   that shows live positions, equity curves, the order book, and a
   system-audit page that turns red when something needs your attention.

It is **paper trading by default** — port 7497 (TWS) or 4002 (IB Gateway).
You have to do the equivalent of editing a config to point at the live
ports (7496 / 4001). That's intentional.

---

## Prerequisites

You need three things before this works:

1. **A computer (Mac recommended)** with Python 3.11+. We'll install Python
   below if you don't have it.
2. **An Interactive Brokers paper account.** Free at
   [interactivebrokers.com](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/) — sign
   up and select "Paper Trading" mode. You won't trade real money.
3. **TWS or IB Gateway** — IBKR's desktop apps. Pick one:
   - **TWS** (Trader Workstation) — full trading workstation; what you'd
     use to look at charts. Bigger app.
   - **IB Gateway** — minimal headless version that just exposes the API.
     Lighter and recommended for unattended trading.
   Download both at
   [interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php).

> The system will work with either app. If you're running both, just pick
> one port (the System Audit page can autodetect either).

---

## First-time install (Mac)

### Step 1 · Install Python and `git` if you don't have them

Open the **Terminal** app (Spotlight → "Terminal"). Then:

```bash
# Install Homebrew (Mac's package manager) — skip if you already have it.
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Python 3.11 and git via Homebrew.
brew install python@3.11 git
```

### Step 2 · Clone this repo

```bash
# Pick a folder to put it in. The default is ~/TradingWorkspace.
mkdir -p ~/TradingWorkspace && cd ~/TradingWorkspace

# Clone via GitHub (replace the URL with your fork if you have one).
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/trading-engine.git
cd trading-engine
```

### Step 3 · Set up a Python virtual environment

```bash
# Create a venv at ~/TradingWorkspace/.venv
python3 -m venv ../.venv

# Activate it. You'll need to run this every time you open a new Terminal.
source ../.venv/bin/activate

# You should now see "(.venv)" at the start of your Terminal prompt.

# Install the project's dependencies.
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt    # OR: pip install -e .  (if pyproject.toml is set up)
```

### Step 4 · Set up TWS or IB Gateway

Open whichever you installed and **log into your paper account**. Then:

**TWS:** File → Global Configuration → API → Settings:
  - ☑ Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients
  - Socket port: `7497` (paper) or `7496` (live)
  - ☐ Read-Only API _(must be unchecked, otherwise we can't submit)_
  - Trusted IPs: leave empty, or add `127.0.0.1`
  - Click OK
  - **File → Save Settings** (the API socket only opens after saving)

**IB Gateway:** Configure → Settings → API → Settings — same options;
ports are `4002` (paper) and `4001` (live).

Verify the API is listening:

```bash
# In Terminal, with TWS or Gateway running:
lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN | grep -E '7497|7496|4001|4002'
# You should see one line with `java` listening on whichever port you picked.
```

### Step 5 · Bootstrap the autonomous schedule

```bash
# This installs a macOS LaunchAgent that fires Mon-Fri 16:32 ET.
# Replace 7497 with 4002 if you're running IB Gateway instead of TWS.
IBKR_PORT_PAPER=7497 \
  python -m src.production.scheduler --install-launchagent

# Confirm it's loaded.
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.capitalfund.daily-runner | head -10
```

Or run **all of the above + sleep settings + auto-login checklist** with
the bundled bootstrap script:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_automation.sh
```

### Step 6 · Open the dashboard

```bash
streamlit run src/dashboard/streamlit_entrypoint.py --server.port 8501
```

Browser opens to `http://localhost:8501`. Click around. The first thing
to verify is the **System Audit** page (left sidebar) — every row should
be green or yellow. Red rows tell you exactly what to fix.

---

## Daily operation

Once installed, the system runs itself:

| What | Where | When |
|---|---|---|
| Pull bars + rebalance + submit orders | LaunchAgent | Mon-Fri 16:32 ET |
| Watch what's happening | Dashboard at `localhost:8501` | Whenever |
| Force a refresh manually | Sidebar **Refresh ETF Data** button | Anytime |
| Halt all trading | `python -m src.execution.kill_switch arm "reason"` | Emergency |
| Resume trading | `python -m src.execution.kill_switch disarm` | After fix |

If you want to manually fire the runner without waiting for the LaunchAgent:

```bash
# Pull data + regenerate targets + (if rebalance day) submit orders.
python -m src.production.daily_runner --port 7497

# Like above but skip order submission.
python -m src.production.daily_runner --port 7497 --dry-run

# Force a rebalance even if not month-end.
python -m src.production.daily_runner --port 7497 --force-rebalance
```

Every folder under `src/` has its own README explaining what's in it

new connector.

```

You can swap any layer independently. Adding a new model = drop a file in
`src/trading_engine/models/catalogue/` + register it in `models/registry.py`.
That's it — the rest of the pipeline picks it up.

22 ETFs. Configurable in the production YAML configs under
`src/production/pipeline/configs/`.

---

## Going beyond ETFs

The same `Signal` protocol used in `src/strategies/etf/` exists for
`src/strategies/futures/` and `src/strategies/options/` — those folders are
structured but currently empty. When you're ready to add an options
overlay or a futures hedge, you implement the same kind of signal class,
register it in the relevant catalogue, and hook it into a new aggregator.
The runtime, dashboard, risk gate, and kill switch don't change.

---

## Safety — what stops bad trades

Three layers of defense before any order leaves your laptop:

1. **Kill switch** (`src/execution/kill_switch.py`) — file-backed boolean.
   Armed by you (or by a future drawdown supervisor). Blocks every
   submission attempt with a clear error message.

2. **Pre-trade risk checks** (`src/runtime/risk_checks.py`) — runs on
   every basket:
   - data validators (no negative prices, no impossible moves, no stale
     symbols)
   - exposure limits (max single position 25%, gross ≤ 100%, net in
     [50%, 100%], min 5 holdings, max single trade 30% NAV)
   - basket non-empty + NAV > 0

3. **Duplicate-submission guard** (`src/dashboard/services/order_service.py`)
   — basket fingerprint persisted to disk; a second submit of the same
   basket fingerprint is refused.

Failing any of the three aborts before connecting to IBKR. The error
message tells you which limit fired and by how much.

## Common questions

**Will this trade on a holiday?**
No. The runner uses a NYSE calendar (`src/common/clock.py`); it skips
holidays and weekends.

**Can I run this on Linux?**
Yes — except the macOS-specific LaunchAgent. Use `cron` or `systemd`
instead. The `daily_runner` itself is platform-agnostic.

**Do I need to keep the laptop awake at 16:32 ET?**
Yes, unless you set up the truly-headless variant in
`scripts/HEADLESS.md` (LaunchDaemon + IBC). The simpler path: enable
auto-login + a 16:30 wake schedule (`pmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRF
16:30:00`).

**Will it sell my whole portfolio?**
No — by default the optimizer is `momentum_tilted` which holds all 22
ETFs with weights tilted toward winners (top weights ~10-12%, all
holdings ≥ 1%). The legacy `momentum_top5` still exists if you want a
concentrated 5-pick portfolio.

**How do I switch from paper to live?**
You don't from this README. There's a deliberate friction step: the
`profile=live` code path requires you to flip a flag, set
`IBKR_PORT_LIVE`, and disarm the live-trading guard. Don't do it until
you've watched the paper system run for at least a month and the System
Audit page is consistently green.
