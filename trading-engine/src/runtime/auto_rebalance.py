"""
auto_rebalance.py — Decide if today is a rebalance day.

A small, intentionally pure module: takes the latest targets DataFrame
and a date, returns ``True`` / ``False`` plus a reason string.  No I/O.
The caller is responsible for loading the targets and acting on the
decision.

Two cadence policies live here:

  * ``decide_rebalance`` — monthly cadence (legacy). Rebalance when the
    calendar month rolls over or there is no prior signal. This mirrors
    the original ``production/daily_runner._needs_rebalance`` and is
    kept for backward compatibility / paper safety.
  * ``decide_rebalance_with_drift`` — daily cadence with a drift band.
    Rebalance when actual weights drift past a threshold from target,
    when the materially-weighted basket composition changes, or as a
    cold start. Includes a global cooldown to suppress same-day churn.

Both are pure: tests hammer them with synthetic inputs without touching
disk or the broker. The daily_runner picks which to call from config.
